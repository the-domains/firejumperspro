**FireJumpersPRO uses the most accurate GIS data of real world locations **so that wildfire agencies can train right in their own backyard! With maps as large as 10 square miles_(or 25 square kilometers)_, agencies can really get that epic scale experience! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2b1ba622-f5df-402f-a113-564a3b0b7f71.png)

The GIS data collected has detailed information on the tile's terrain type, fuel load, fire behavior, elevation, slope as well as how it dynamically effects unit movement speeds and fire suppression tactics.

FireJumpersPRO offers one of the most immersive wildland firefighting simulation and give agencies the right tools they need to train crew members in tactical decision making.
