**Water bombers** are a big part of any wildfire suppression operation. In FireJumpersPRO, water bombers have many parameters from water capacity (gal), water input/output speeds (gpm or gps), min/max velocity, effective radius and much more! Based on these properties, FireJumpersPRO takes care of the rest, from how much water gets dropped within a given surface area and how it effectively suppresses the fire intensity. It also auto-calculates the distance required over a lake to refill it's tank capacity.
